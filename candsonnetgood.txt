If we must die, let it not be like hogs
Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs
Making their mock at our accursed lot
If we must die, let it not be like hogs
So that our precious blood may not be shed
In vain; then even the monsters we defy
Shall be constrained to honor us, though dead;
Oh kinsman!  We must meet the common foe;
Though far outumbered, let us still be brave
And for their thousand blows deal one deathblow!
What though before us flies the open grave?
Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack
Pressed to the wall, dying but fighting back!
