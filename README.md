Code for Ships of Theseus

Shakespeare sonnet project

Replacing Shakespeare's sonnets one line at a time

Usage (current)

To display the historical state after X lines had been replaced:

If you run ruby print_on_demand.rb from this directory it will prompt you for a range (first sonnet to last) with defaults 1 and 154

Then it will ask for the number of lines to replace (0 = all Shakespare 2156 = all mine)

A line starting with ** indicates that a line was replaced at this point
