There once was a man from Nantucket
Who had a remarkable girth
The ladies did swoon
When he slipped it inside
And he flew through a flaw in the flue
Shall I compare thee to a Summer's Eve
Thou art far more douchey
When I have fears tat I may cease to be
Milk milk lemonade around the corner
Now I lay me, lay me down to sleep
Little Jack Horner sat in his corner
Dice Claying poor Little Bo Peep
Whatever happened to my lost Lenore
Who vanished long ago from Baltimore
